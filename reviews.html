<p>"Ah yes, one of my favorite games in the series. I honestly love the new things they added like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trio Attacks</li>
  <li>New Bros. Attacks</li>
  <li>New Trio Moves to use in the hubworld</li>
  <li>Paper Mario</li>

</ul>
<p>Ok seriously, I LOVE playing as Paper Mario in battle AND in the hubworld. The graphics are amazing as well. And the songs SLAP."<strong>- Zyan Martin</strong>

<p>"Why do so many people dislike this game? It really isn't that bad. I personally enjoy saving all those Toads. The inclusion of Paper Mario in a   Mario & Luigi game is great. The puzzles are fun. So are the bosses. The  locations are interesting. It may not have all the creative characters in the  first few games, but this is still a really fun game to play." <strong>- Joshua Forester</strong>

<p>"Every battle was very engaging, and it was very entertaining to play numerous times, I understand what people say when it missed potential, but gameplay is all I really care for."<strong> - Robert Sharp</strong>
